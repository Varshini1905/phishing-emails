&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 3. Check Email Headers for Discrepancies
- I used an online header analyzer, such as [Google Message Header Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/)
- Analyzed the "Received" fields to trace the email's path and identified unusual routing or delays.
- Found discrepancies in the "Return-Path" and "From" addresses.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 4. Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments
- The email does not specify the user’s name and uses a generic greeting.
- The first sentence creates a sense of urgency, encouraging the user to act without thinking.
- There are grammar and spelling errors in the email upon closer inspection.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 5. Look for Urgent or Threatening Language in the Email Body
- Phrases that create a sense of urgency include "Your account will be suspended!"
- The email contains threats of negative consequences if the recipient does not comply with the request.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 6. Note Any Mismatched URLs
- Hovering over links reveals the actual URL, which may differ from the displayed text.
- Discrepancies suggest that the link could lead to a different site than intended.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 7. Verify Presence of Spelling or Grammar Errors
- The email contains spelling mistakes and awkward phrasing.
- Errors that a native speaker would likely not make indicate a phishing attempt.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 8. Summarize Phishing Traits Found in the Email
Compile a list of identified traits, such as:
- Spoofed sender email address
- Suspicious links or attachments
- Urgent or threatening language
- Mismatched URLs
- The user’s name hasn’t been specified and it’s a generic greeting.
- Spelling or grammar errors
