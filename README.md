# Phishing Email Analysis Guide
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 1. Obtain a Sample Phishing Email
- Visit websites that provide phishing email examples, such as [Hook Security](https://www.hooksecurity.co/phishing-email-examples) or [Terranova Security](https://www.terranovasecurity.com).
- Download or copy a sample email for analysis.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 2. Examine Sender's Email Address for Spoofing
- Check if the sender's email address matches the expected domain of the organization.
- Look for slight misspellings or unusual characters in the domain name that could indicate spoofing.
- Use tools like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com) to verify the sender's domain.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 3. Check Email Headers for Discrepancies
- Use an online header analyzer, such as [Google Message Header Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/) or [Message Header Analyzer](https://mha.azurewebsites.net/).
- Analyze the "Received" fields to trace the email's path and identify any unusual routing or delays.
- Look for discrepancies in the "Return-Path" and "From" addresses.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 4. Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments
- Hover over any links in the email to reveal the actual URL.
- Check if the link's domain matches the sender's organization.
- Look for unexpected attachments, especially those with executable file types (e.g., .exe, .scr).
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 5. Look for Urgent or Threatening Language in the Email Body
- Identify phrases that create a sense of urgency, such as "Act now!" or "Your account will be suspended!"
- Note any threats of negative consequences if the recipient does not comply with the request.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 6. Note Any Mismatched URLs
- Hover over links to see the actual URL and compare it with the displayed text.
- Look for discrepancies that suggest the link leads to a different site than intended.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## 7. Verify Presence of Spelling or Grammar Errors
- Read through the email for any spelling mistakes or awkward phrasing.
- Pay attention to errors that a native speaker would likely not make, which can indicate a phishing attempt.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Compile a list of identified traits, such as:
- Spoofed sender email address
